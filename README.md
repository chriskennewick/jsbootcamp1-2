Code Fellows JS Bootcamp
========================

This is the continuation of the starter project we'll be working with as part of
the Fall 2013 JS Bootcamp.

Adding the following:
Create a new hbs view
Create a new route to hit it
Install an arbitrary front end library with bower
Get that library code running with some functionality in that new view
Get some jquery functionality running in that view relating to forms/blur/focus
add a grunt-contrib-watch, configure livereload
commit consistently
push to your github account under a new project
be prepared to show the class the diff monday morning
